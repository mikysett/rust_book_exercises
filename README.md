This repo contains the solved exercises of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Why to learn Rust (for me)

This languange seems fascinating and very attractive since it tries to solve issues that other new languages do not solve.
I'm speaking about operative system issues, extreme efficiency and safety that (now) translate to hard to read/write/debug code.
I'm very curious to see how Rust tackle this challenge (I'm pretty sure I won't be disappointed).
